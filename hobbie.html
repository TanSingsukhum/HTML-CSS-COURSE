                Hello everyone! Although I'm a Computer Science major student, one thing that I want you to know is that I have a life!
            </h1>
            <p>
                I have many hobbies, and I'm willing to share them here!
            </p>
            <p>
                Soccer has to be my first hobby that I started when I was six years old. I'm really consistent when it comes to soccer, but I've had to stop playing soccer a couple of times due to injury. I'm also a fan of soccer clubs, with my favorites being Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Bayern Munich. Three of these clubs are top in their own league. My favorite soccer player of all time has to be Cristiano Ronaldo, or CR7, and my favorite women's soccer player would be Alex Morgan.
